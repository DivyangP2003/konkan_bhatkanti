## 📌 Problem Statement

The Konkan region, known for its rich cultural heritage, spiritual significance, and breathtaking natural beauty, remains an underexplored gem in India's tourism map. Popular destinations are often overcrowded, while equally valuable but lesser-known places go unnoticed.

This leads to:
- Poor tourist experience due to overcrowding
- Environmental strain on specific hotspots
- Missed economic opportunities for local communities
